# Fishtest Worker Kubernetes Deployment (Including Control Plane)
#
# This version allows running on control plane nodes with 3 replicas.
# For worker-only deployment with 2 replicas, use kubernetes-sample-deployment.yaml
#
# IMPORTANT: Before editing credentials, copy this file to kubernetes-sample-deployment-including-control-plane-my.yaml
# Files ending with -my.* are in .gitignore and will not be committed to the repository.
#
# Usage:
#   cp kubernetes-sample-deployment-including-control-plane.yaml kubernetes-sample-deployment-including-control-plane-my.yaml
#   # Edit kubernetes-sample-deployment-including-control-plane-my.yaml with your credentials
#   kubectl apply -f kubernetes-sample-deployment-including-control-plane-my.yaml
